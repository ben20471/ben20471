Hi there, I am **ben20471**, aka **Your local GX 317**. I have a ton of completely random and unreleated interests, the most notables being:
- ðŸš‰ Railways
- ðŸŽ® Video games

In terms of projects, I am currently derecting torwards making activities for routes [MSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Train_Simulator) (**M**icro**S**oft **T**rain **S**imulator, not to be confused with [Train Simulator Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_Simulator_Classic)) railway simulaton game from 2001, which you can download [here](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/microsoft-train-simulator-g3v), or, if youâ€™re feeling like it, buy a physical copy (available on various websites including Amazon and eBay).
