Hi there, I am **ben20471**, aka **Your local GX 317**. I have a ton of completely random and unreleated interests, the most notable being:
- ðŸš‰ Railways
- ðŸŽ® Video games

I have tried quite a lot of languages and software, such as:
- PowerShell (limited knowledge)
- C# (didn't get really far past hello world)
- Roblox Studio (limited knowledge overall, inexistent knowledge of Lua)
- Blender (very limited knoledge)
- [TSRE5 route editor](https://kionec.org/tsre5) for the [Open Rails](https://www.openrails.org) game (I know how it works but struggle to actually build things)
